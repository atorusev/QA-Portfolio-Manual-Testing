# TimeWise

**Description**: TimeWise is a task management application that helps users create, edit, and manage tasks. This project demonstrates both functional and API testing.

## Artifacts

1. **[TimeWise.xlsx](./TimeWise.xlsx)**: Functional test cases covering key features like task creation, editing, and deletion.

  - Task management (Create, Edit, Delete)
- **Tools Used**: Excel, Postman, and a live testing environment.

## Highlights

- Comprehensive testing coverage of both UI and API.
